# Leaflet Challenge
The United States Geological Survey had scientists interested in building new methods and tools that would allow them to display various pieces of useful infomation about the earth. One thing imparticular that they where looking to build was a set of tools that could make visualizations of earthquake data.
Using leaflet I developed a map that would allow the visualization of earthquake data to be displayed clearly and in a way that can be easily interpreted by all. 


Leaflet was used for the interactivity and the html files display the data. Open Street Maps was also used for the base maps.
